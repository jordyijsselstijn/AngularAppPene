# AngularAppPene
School assignment for Serious Javascript

READ THIS FIRST! - THE SONG PAGE SOMEHOW IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY IN CHROME, TURN OFF AUDIO TO PROTECT YOUR EARS!

This app shows the abilities of Angular as a MV* framework.

- It contains views for shows, videos, songs and partials for individual shows, the addition form for shows, a youtube player, a song player (doesn't work on Chrome somehow :S). 
- It let's you post a form to a PHP script on the back-end (afterwards refresh the page)
- It gets all the shows from the PHP backend
- It retrieves an eventpicture from facebook if a correct event link is passed in
- It retrieves all Pene Corrida songs from the Soundcloud API
- It retrieves video's from youtube using a library
- The side-bar is a seperate view and contains all it's own methods

Cool project to work on! :)
